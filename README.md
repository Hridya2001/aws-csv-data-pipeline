## Project Workflow

1. Source CSV File
   A CSV file is manually uploaded to the source S3 bucket "csv-raw-data-bucket"

2. Lambda Trigger & Preprocessing
   The S3 upload event triggers an AWS Lambda function, which:
    - Reads the raw CSV file.
    - Performs necessary preprocessing.
    - Saves the processed output to another S3 bucket "csv-processed-data-bucket"

3. Glue Crawler & ETL Job
   A Glue Crawler scans the processed data and creates a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

   A Glue Visual ETL Job (SQL-based transformation only) is run on this table.

   The job output is stored in the final S3 bucket "csv-final-data-bucket".

5. Visualization in QuickSight
   The final transformed dataset is connected to Amazon QuickSight.

   Dashboards and visuals are created using the final output.
